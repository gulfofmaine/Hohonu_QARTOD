This tool is specifically designed to generate QARTOD and NERACOOS dataset configuration files for the Hohonu sites with test range suggestions based on conditions in the Gulf Of Maine, but could be used for Hohonu gauges in other regions.

[Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) is used to managed dependencies, but with standard PyPI packages to hopefully play nice with [Streamlit cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud). 

`pixi run start` to launch locally.

In order to communicate with the Hohonu API, you will need an API key.
You can see yours at https://dashboard.hohonu.io/profile if you have an account.
